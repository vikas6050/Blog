# Learning Git and GitHub: A Roadmap

### Introduction

_Hello everyone! Today, I want to share my journey and the valuable lessons I learned while diving into the world of Git and GitHub. As a developer, I quickly realized that mastering these tools is essential in the technical environment, given the vast number of users on platforms like GitHub and GitLab. I'll recount my initial mistakes and provide you with a roadmap to learn Git and GitHub effectively._

**Getting Started
When I first embarked on this journey, I had no clear roadmap. I started by diving into books and watching YouTube videos. However, one significant mistake I made was not understanding the difference between Git and GitHub right from the start. I began learning GitHub commands without realizing that Git and GitHub are distinct entities. This confusion led to frustration initially, but once I grasped the difference, everything became much clearer.**

### Roadmap to Learning Git and GitHub

1. Master the Terminal (Max 1 Day)
   Before diving into Git and GitHub, it's crucial to be comfortable with the command line interface. Here are some fundamental commands to get you started:

- pwd: Shows the path of the present directory.
- ls: Lists the files in the current directory.
- ls -a: Lists all files, including hidden ones, in the directory.
- mkdir <foldername>: Creates a folder in the current directory.
- touch <filename>: Creates a file in the current directory.
- cd ..: Moves up one directory level.

### 2. Learn Git (4-5 Days)

Now, let's focus solely on Git. Forget about GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket for the moment. Here's how to get started:

Check if Git is installed on your system (on macOS, it's pre-installed; on Windows, you might need to install it).
Learn the basics of Git, its purpose, and why it's essential.
Start practicing Git commands. Begin with git init to initialize a Git repository.

### 3. Explore GitHub, GitLab, and/or Bitbucket (7-10 Days for Proficiency)

Once you have a solid understanding of Git, it's time to explore Git hosting platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. Here's what you should focus on:

- Familiarize yourself with the platform of your choice.
- Learn about concepts like merging, branching, adding files, committing with messages, pushing, pulling, checking out branches, and rebasing.
- Practice these concepts extensively to strengthen your understanding.
